## Course Overview

Understanding how data changes over time is essential for specifying suitable 
forecasting models. Comprehensively exploring modern time-series datasets is
challenging, where a large number of frequently observed time series contains 
many patterns. This workshop introduces new exploratory techniques to uncover 
meaningful temporal patterns in time series data.

Weâ€™ll explore how to compare patterns across many series using feature-based 
summaries. Visualizing these features reveals common temporal patterns, cluster 
related time series, and see how these patterns vary throughout the hierarchical
structure of the data.

We'll then use a grammar of time series graphics to produce plots that clearly
show the shape and variability in these patterns. Special attention will be 
given to the complexities of sub-daily data (such as timezones), allowing us to
create stunning calendar plots which uncovers holiday effects and complex
seasonalities.

This practical workshop features live demonstrations and hands-on exercises 
using real-world data, equipping participants with the skills to effectively 
manipulate and visualize time series data in R.

This workshop will run in-person at [ISF 2025](https://isf.forecasters.org/program/workshops/) in Beijing, China on June 29th 2025.

# Preparation

The workshop will provide a quick-start overview of exploring time series data and producing forecasts. There is no need for prior experience in time series to get the most out of this workshop.

It is expected that you are comfortable with writing R code and using tidyverse packages including dplyr and ggplot2. If you are unfamiliar with writing R code or using the tidyverse, consider working through the learnr materials here: <https://learnr.numbat.space/>.

Some familiarity with statistical concepts such as the mean, variance, quantiles, normal distribution, and regression would be helpful to better understand the forecasts, although this is not strictly necessary.

## Required equipment

Please bring your own laptop capable of running R.

## Required software

To be able to complete the exercises of this workshop, please install a suitable IDE (such as RStudio), a recent version of R (4.1+) and the following packages.

-   **Time series packages and extensions**
    -   fpp3
    -   sugrrants

The following code will install the main packages needed for the workshop.

```r
install.packages(c("fpp3", "sugrrants"))
```

Please have the required software installed and pre-work completed before attending the workshop.
