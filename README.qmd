#### Description

Understanding how data changes over time is essential for specifying suitable 
forecasting models. Comprehensively exploring modern time-series datasets is
challenging, where a large number of frequently observed time series contains 
many patterns. This workshop introduces new exploratory techniques to uncover 
meaningful temporal patterns in time series data.

Weâ€™ll explore how to compare patterns across many series using feature-based 
summaries. Visualizing these features reveals common temporal patterns, cluster 
related time series, and see how these patterns vary throughout the hierarchical
structure of the data.

We'll then use a grammar of time series graphics to produce plots that clearly
show the shape and variability in these patterns. Special attention will be 
given to the complexities of sub-daily data (such as timezones), allowing us to
create stunning calendar plots which uncovers holiday effects and complex
seasonalities.

This practical workshop features live demonstrations and hands-on exercises 
using real-world data, equipping participants with the skills to effectively 
manipulate and visualize time series data in R.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  How to use the tidyverse to wrangle and manipulate time series data
2.  Visualise data and identify common time series patterns
3.  Use time series features to find patterns in many time series
4.  Apply the grammar of time series graphics to visualize complex seasonalities

#### Structure

<!-- 
Hour 1: Time series data, aggregations, and visualization basics 
Hour 2: Time series decomposition and features 
Hour 3: The grammar of time series graphics 
-->

**Session 1** (13:00 - 14:20)

The first session explores common time series patterns.
Starting with identifying trend and seasonality in a single time series, we will work toward summarising patterns across a large collections of time series.

* Time series data
* Temporal granularity, statistics, and aggregation
* Time series patterns and time plots
* STL decomposition
* Feature analysis

**Session 2** (14:30 - 15:50)

The second session focuses on calendrical patterns such as seasonality and holidays.
We will start with visualising seasonal patterns in highly aggregated quarterly data and work toward visualising complex seasonal patterns in sub-daily data.

* Seasonal plots (aes/data -> scale -> coord)
* Seasonal sub-series plots
* Exploring seasonality after STL decomposition
* Multiple seasonality in daily and sub-daily data
* Local/civil and global/absolute time
* Calendar plots

**User-study** (15:50 - 16:00)



### Format

3 hour workshop.
