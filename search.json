    "text": "Course Overview\nUnderstanding how data changes over time is essential for specifying suitable forecasting models. Comprehensively exploring modern time-series datasets is challenging, where a large number of frequently observed time series contains many patterns. This workshop introduces new exploratory techniques to uncover meaningful temporal patterns in time series data.\nWe’ll explore how to compare patterns across many series using feature-based summaries. Visualizing these features reveals common temporal patterns, cluster related time series, and see how these patterns vary throughout the hierarchical structure of the data.\nWe’ll then use a grammar of time series graphics to produce plots that clearly show the shape and variability in these patterns. Special attention will be given to the complexities of sub-daily data (such as timezones), allowing us to create stunning calendar plots which uncovers holiday effects and complex seasonalities.\nThis practical workshop features live demonstrations and hands-on exercises using real-world data, equipping participants with the skills to effectively manipulate and visualize time series data in R.\nThis workshop will run in-person at ISF 2025 in Beijing, China on June 29th 2025."
